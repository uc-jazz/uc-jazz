                        <p>Currently, UC Jazz consists of multiple combos, ranging in size from 3 to 8 musicians. The combos are divided into Intermediate and Advanced categories. Auditions for everyone are held at the beginning of every fall semester. UC Jazz provides rehearsal space, also available for individual use by UCJ students, for music and non-music majors, as well as for undergrad and graduate students.</p>
                        <p>The combos cover a wide range of repertoire and styles and much emphasis is placed on how to perform in an ensemble. Ensembles meet weekly, and along with our annual Fall and Spring concerts, UC Jazz students perform in over 40 events per year on and off campus. Student arrangements and compositions are always encouraged.</p>

                            <h3>Kai Eckhardt</h3>
                            <p>Kai Eckhardt is an Afro-European musician who has made a significant contribution to the evolution of
                                the electric bass since 1989. Heavily influenced by the emerging fusion of funk, rock and jazz in the late
                                70's, Kai developed a unique style on his instrument long before attending Berklee College of music in
                                Boston - the renowned music college- from which he graduated with honors in 1987. Under the
                                guidance of Tiger Okoshi, Bob Moses and Gary Burton, Kai was introduced directly to pioneering
                                guitarist John McLaughlin, who at the time was forming a new trio together with Indian born
                                percussionist Trilok Gurtu.
                            </p>
                            <p>Kai has performed at distinguished venues around the globe such as the Royal Festival Hall in
                                London, the Philharmonic in Munich and the Esplanade in Singapore. Festival engagements include
                                Montreal Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz Festival in the Hague, Womad World Music Festival in Spain and
                                Glastonbury in the U.K. Kai has performed for dignitaries on some occasions like the King and Queen of
                                Norway. In the educational field, Kai teaches clinics and master classes internationally. Engagements
                                include Berklee in Boston, the Musician’s Institute in Hollywood, the Bruckner Conservatory in Austria
                                and Amsterdam Conservatory in the Netherlands. Perhaps the most notably unique band in Kai's
                                career was the pioneering jam-band Garaj Mahal, which he co-lead between 2000 and 2010, producing
                                9 albums and performing roughly 1000 concerts in the U.S and Canada.
